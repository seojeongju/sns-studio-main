"""Post status aggregation helpers.

Editorial status lives on ``PlatformPost`` — each social account flows through
the workflow independently. ``Post.status`` is a *derived* property computed
from its children. This module holds the pure aggregation function so it can
be reused by model properties, views, and tests.
